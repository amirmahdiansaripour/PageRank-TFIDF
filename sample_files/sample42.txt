overall synapsis the pacific natural foods organic free range chix broth is a very healthy alternative to most of the broth sold on the market s and it has a neutral flavor to let one either spice it up and keep it down it tastes decent not especially flavorful when compare to some other brands it has lower sodium and than a lot of broths out there but the sea salt gives it a more salty taste it does not use a lot of articificial ingredients other stock broths put in theirs overall a decent stock for general use detailed review for those wanting more indepth review note most stores sell broths and not stock so in my review i often will use broth when comparing the stock to other broths the ones in the supermarkets hope this helps taste it is neutral but we like to add our own ingredients to our own soups anyways a lot of times other stock broth have a bit too much onion garlic or other spices this one is pretty plain in flavor thus it gives the cook chef a lot more creativity because it is organic and free range the stock is heartier and heavier than regular watered down steroid laden chix broths meaning it has a bit more cloudiness to it than the regular clear chix broth out there it does leave a taste behind not exactly an after taste but a nice finish per se we have used this stock for something as simple as homemade egg drop soup using little bit of sliced ginger taken out after cooking salt to taste and once the soup heated up adding some dissolved corn starch letting it boil again turned off then dropping a well beaten egg by drizzling it over the top of the soup to create a flowery effect the chinese call it egg flower soup vs egg drop soup to something as hearty as minestrone it is not very good all by itself as we have served this to our sick children and they can not seem to swallow it plain myself as well when i was sick when we just wanted some clear broth without added salt or flavoring the broth itself is very bland it does not have a canned taste to it and that is a nice sizeit is rare to find stocks broths in this serving size most broths come much larger when i am by myself i can just open one up without wasting the extras and amazon do sell the bigger sizes on the site but when you compare oz to oz this size is actually slightly cheaper about cents than the regular sizes making it the perfect serving size do bear in mind that prices at amazon changes all the packagingwe like the tetra pak packing of this product it does not have a metallic taste to it it is nicely packed in packs so it stores easily on the shelf without taking up a lot of space round cans really waste spaces while these tetra square packes utilize every inch of the cabinet space the only downside to the packaging is that it is not recyclable for us in our does it groove make gravy why this matters a lot of folks like to make gravies with their broth and we have been asked by our friends quite a bit why we prefer to use stocks vs broths when it comes to making gravy for those that are interested there is a bit of difference between stock and broth stock are bones marrow cooked thus more gelatinous broth are meat prepped so it does not have gelatin to it this makes a difference when one wants to make something thick like gravy a good gravy requires a bit of help from the stock itself to gelatinize and while one can make gravy with broth stocks are superior when it comes to making things such as gravies this stock however does not make gravy well for some reason not sure why we have tested it a few times it requires much more flour than the conventional recipes so bare that in mind if you want to make gravy with the this stock on the other hand i would highly recommend the stock made by wolfgang puck it is a better stock both in flavor and grooving ability odds and endsthis broth is a good and healthy alternative to those that like lower sodium options and do not like a lot of flavoring to their soup what makes it even better is not just that it is organic but free range by definition organic means that the chickens are not fed hormones and are fed natural grains but that does not mean that they can roam free they might still be caged up in a limited space free range means the chicken can roam more freely although some farmers have argued that chicken that can have feet of range is consider free range it is still better than being couped up in a x square with their beaks cut off and being injected by nothing but steroids a chicken that can roam is definitely a healthier chicken they produce more muscular meat and healthier bones and we get to benefit from that we have switched to as much free range chicken as we could afford while at least all organic and have seen a good healthy change in our bodies along with other diets and exercises i would also recommend having wolfgang pucks organic chicken broth and chicken stock on hand they sell it here on amazon the wolfgang puck brand stock is more flavorful and stands more on its own and creates recipes that are more flavorful we use this product whenever we want to serve something more neutral when pairing with other more flavorful foods on a sick day the wolfgang puck broth is superior by itself in plain taste we prefer broths over stocks the wolfgang puck is broth is excellent by itself but we still like this product a lot for its healthy and neutral taste thus giving us a lot of room for creativity note some of the folks have complained that it is too salty while others stated that it is low sodium i personally think everyone is taste buds are different and i have cooked for folks for dinner at the same time that would say my dishes are too salty to not salty at all i think some of that has to do with the way we grow up the way our genetics are and our age and habits if a person has cut down on their salt intake for a period of time their taste buds will be more sensitive to salt in this case sea salt is a very strong salt using just a pinch of it can equal to the times the taste of the table spoon salt but the sodium level is still lower because less salt is used i can see why some folks would say it tastes too salty while others say it is not that salty to me and my wife our salt intake tend to be on the higher end so this broth does not taste salty to us hope this helps totally unimportant view btw no matter how healthy or good the broth is for humans it is always bad for the chicken s themselves organic free range or caged makes one wonder if they would ever think maybe we should not cross the road because the butcher is on the other side
