i have tried pretty much all the no calorie and low calorie sugar substitutes available none of them are perfect do not expect anything to taste exactly like sugar except sugar because there is nothing that tastes exactly like sugar except for sugar that is a fact the human taste buds especially in certain individuals are extremely sensitive to the various flavors each sweetener provides often sweeteners are compared to sugar but in reality high calorie sugar substitutes like fructose even taste different from sugar so please stop comparing other sweeteners to sugar because only sugar tastes exactly like sugar and attempting to find a sweetener with a different molecular structure that tastes exactly like sugar is impossible because the human taste buds can sense even the slightest difference in the molecular structure of the sweetener now with that said there are today available many sweeteners each with their own positive and negative attributes the number one sweetener in the world is sugar and most people find sugar to be the best tasting sweetener that is why it is number one the low calorie alternatives include both natural sweeteners erythritol stevia xylitol lo han etc and man made sweeteners nutrasweet saccharine splenda etc this product is a mix of the three natural sweeteners erythritol isomaltulose and reb a a sweetener extracted from stevia as well as natural flavors to make the taste more like sugar erythritol is a great all natural low calorie sweetener on it is own but it lacks depth and imparts sort of a watery sweetness unless mixed with other sweeteners it goes very well with stevia and is commonly found mixed with stevia based sweeteners as is the case in this product the combination greatly enriches the sweetness of each of the two distinct sweeteners stevia normally contains stevioside reb a rebaudioside a reb c rebaudioside c and dulcoside a of these reb a is the most desirable sweetest and lacks the bitterness of the others most high quality stevia products contain mostly reb a reb a on it is own has a shallow but pleasant sweetness it is a sharp sweetness and goes very well with other sweeteners that help broaden it is sweetness such as xylitol erythritol sugar lo han etc the fact that purevia only uses reb a from stevia means that it has none of the bitter aftertaste of some of the other popular stevia products available isomaltulose is a full calorie sweetener very similar to sugar but like erythritol and reb a it does not promote tooth decay it is presence helps to give purevia a richer full bodied sweetness ok so those are the facts but how does it actually stand up against the other sweeteners available the taste is excellent most of the people i know who have tried it like it a lot it has a flavor very similar to sugar but like all other sweeteners out there it has its own unique flavor there is no bitter aftertaste or unnatural chemical taste present it is sweetness is full bodied not thin or watery the manufacturers did a fantastic job of mixing the various sweeteners together to produce a rich full bodied sweetness it has none of the drawbacks of most common stevia products a thin flavor bitter aftertaste none of the drawbacks of erythritol watery sweetness and to top it off its all natural what natural flavors are added are of course a trade secret and these are partially responsible for purevia is flavor being very similar to sugar purevia is simply one of the best sugar substitutes you can buy there are a few others that are as good such as nustevia and truvia but each one has its own unique flavor not everyone is going to agree on which one is the best tasting because each person has their own taste preferences i really like purevia is individual tube packets better than those of most other products they are easier to use they are tubes rather than flat envelopes this makes it much easier to dispense one bit of advice if you are very picky about a full bodied sweetness no matter which sweetener you prefer using more than one sweetener nearly always improves the flavor profile for example a mix of splenda nutrasweet and saccharine will give a more full bodied flavor than each one can alone the same is true for the natural sweeteners sugar and fructose together give a richer taste when combined together stevia and lo han give a richer taste when combined together in general the more sweeteners you combine the richer the taste you can get a sweetness that is better than sugar alone by mixing different sweeteners together also keep in mind that natural low calorie sweeteners like stevia and lo han vary dramatically from one brand to another with the more refined ones generally being the most expensive and best tasting a combination i often use is saccharine mixed with a stevia based sweetener such as purevia nustevia sun crystals etc saccharin was once thought to cause cancer in humans but this is no longer believed to be true recent tests show it to be one of the safest manmade sugar substitutes available far better for you than splenda or nutrasweet and it is very cheap i use a little bit just enough to give the other sweetener a richer flavor saccharine has an off flavor that is unpleasant if too much is added so i only add it as a booster the other low calorie sweetener i will sometimes add is all natural lo han such as lo han sweet sweet sensation natural luo han guo syrup etc lo han has a very unique taste almost like brown sugar or honey it is rather pricey so i will use just a little bit it greatly enhances the sweetness of other sweeteners i avoid using splenda and nutrasweet because they are obviously very unhealthy splenda gives me stomach pains and nutrasweet makes me feel drugged driving on a nutrasweet drugged brain is dangerous so i avoid those like the plague give this product a try only you will know if you like it or not it is one of the best stevia based products you can buy because it uses only reb a from stevia it does not have the infamous bitter taste of many other stevia products similar stevia based products with the same quality include nustevia and truvia sun crystals is another new stevia based product that i like it is stevia mixed with sugar but the stevia extract is not pure reb a and therefore it has a slight aftertaste like sweetleaf has but i like it nonetheless people who like stevia in general are likely going to love this product people who have tried bad quality stevia in the past and were put off by the bitterness of a poor quality stevia product should give this product a shot it is not truly a stevia product because it only contains reb a and none of the other sweeteners and compounds found in stevia that impart a bitter aftertaste reb a is a very decent sweetener much better than the other sweeteners found in stevia most stevia products contain a mix of all the sweeteners found in stevia plus other compounds present which impart a bitter taste reb a is an isolated sweetener which does not taste the same as a full stevia extract much like how sugar does not taste like sugar cane or brown sugar pure reb a is more expensive than a common stevia extract and so expect to pay a little more for it the flavor of reb a is a lot better than a normal stevia extract it is sort of like thin tasting sugar because purevia contains two other sweeteners and natural flavors the taste is far better than reb a is alone i really have to hand it to the manufacturers they did a great job
