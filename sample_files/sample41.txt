despite the reservations i have about this product carnation instant breatkfast essentials complete nutritional drink no sugar added ounces pack of i must say here that it tastes very very very very very good yummy it is somewhat of a misnomer then that i give it only two stars i do like it but the only thing i like about it is the taste and the fact that it mixes easily however i do have very serious reservations about the sweetener combination which is in this product and the fact that it labeled clearly but in a place somewhat difficult to find on the label not a low calorie food this powder mixes well with milk but as with many ready to mix drinks one must add the powder to the milk and mix the old idea of adding a bit of milk to the powder making a paste then adding more milk only makes for a cakey mess with these newer products so it is curious to me that the directions on the back of the package say to mix scoop cup or level tablespoons into large glass add cup cold fat free milk stir well i guess it could work both ways making a paste of a small amount of milk and a small amount of poweder is still not recommended here rather adding a lot of milk to the powder but i find that adding the powder to the milk works well for me and yes it is filling not quite so filling as the now nutrition chocolate whey mix which i have also reviewed for amazon but this carnation instant breakfast essentials milk chocolate no sugar added drink is much much easier to prepare and also has fewer calories however carnation instant breakfast drink essentials milk chocolate no sugar added is not a low calorie food it says so in smallish letters right there on the bottom of the left side of the cannister just where a picture of the front of the cannister most usually used to advertise this product will not show it it is true that the only trace of sugar in this drink is from the lactose in the powdered nonfat milk which is the first ingredient listed this gives the product grams of sugar not a lot but the strange thing is however that this product though hiding the words not a low calorie food on its label actually has made me lose weight yes it took some effort but not as mcuh as usually because carnation instant breakfast essentials at least in this milk chocolate flavour did make me feel full and not too hungry for at least three hours it contains calories per serving without milk compared to calories per serving also without milk of the less costly full sugar version a low calorie food probably has less than calories per serving but as the product here being reviewed did make me feel full and also gave me vitamins and minerals i was able to lose about pounds using it as one of my meals each day but although i totally love chocolate drinks it did get a bit boring drinkng just this chocolate milk drink for one meal each day hmmm i see it also comes in the sugared variety in chocolate malt flavour yum i have always loved chocolate malteds ever since i was little ok it will have twice the calories but even so using envelopes as i sometimes do per glass size this would give me calories per ounce glass not bad or a meal the only trouble is of course that flavours other than plain chocolate as is the item being reviewed here plain vanilla and plain strawberrry are available only in individual envelope boxes i like the freedom and lesser expense of a cannister which is why i probably bought the chocolate flavour instead of the chocolate malt flavour this first time oh well i guess i can always combine them the no sugar powedered chocolate flavour being reviewed here and probably most of the other flavours contains powdered milk which is nice if all you want to add is water however the powdered milk used here though fat free is not lactose free which is important if you are lactose intolerant true there is no sugar in this product however here is where i get very nervous reading the ingredients and imbibing the product however good it may taste for what gives this product its sweet tast is two other kinds of sweetening acesulfame potassium and sucralose which usually goes by the trade name of splenda sucralose as splenda has been called the safest of the artificial sweeteners in eat this not that supermarket survival guide by david zinczenko and matt goulding and is recommended highly by dr jana klauer a park avenue new york diet doctor in her book how the rich get thin still sucralose splenda has been linked to shrinkage of the body is vital t cells as these grow shorter a person ages more and being made from sugar albeit changed from sugar by replacing one sugar molecule with another it still oould concievably cause cancer as it is made from sugar to begin with however i personally am much more concerned about the acesulfame potassium a p sweetener in this product although acesufame potassium is often mixed with splenda sucralose in many products i do not like the idea of a p which has often been cited as a potential cancer causer and unlike splenda sucralose is not made from a naturally occuring substance sugar to be mixed with anything else except maybe with sugar itself which is totally natural mixing a p with anything else even the relatively safe splenda sucralose raises little alarm bells in my mind maybe i am being overly cautious here but when i mentioned this to my doctor he agreed therefore i feel this product should be used with caution even by diabetics diabetics have enough problems surely they do not need a potential cancer causer combination the regular sugared variety of carnation breakfast essentials milk chocolate or any other flavour will be my choice from now on there is about twice as much product in the non sugar free variety this sugar free variety has on its label not a low calorie food right there on the bottom left of the front of the label as i have stated before still as i also stated before it actually did make me feel full and therefore did help me lose a little weight but yes this is yummy stuff very very tasty but i am reminded of a fairy tale in which a human man was captured by an ogre the ogre is wife gave him some oatmeal poisoned oatmeal this stuff is good said the man can i have some more certainly said the ogre is wife sadly the man was soon not able to ask for a third helping or indeed anything else another reviewer has said that it gives him or her diarrhea but this can have a good effect on those beset with constipation bu there are other remedies for constipation and i am hoping that carnation breakfast essentials regular milk chocolate flavour will be one of them
