update read the update below first thanks june and august i was but no more actively anyway we have four cats two normals who eat about anything one with kidney disease crf ckd and accompanying reduced appetite and one that has picky and weird tastes in the process of trying to find an appetite stimulant for the mom cat with crf ckd i tried out several products on her and the others the kids as well here are the results of this less than scientific or definitive survey drs foster smith shrimp snappies treats ground to powder all refused freeze dried powders prowl and ziwi peak no effect all but one ms picky ate them seafood juices tuna oyster sardine etc no effect all but same one ate them dry ground to powder cat food halo evo blue fuffalo etc no effect ditto acceptance canned cat food gourmet brands renal diets ditto hairball tube lubes usual suspects cat grass ditto mark chappells de furr ums treats ditto calming chews liquid pet naturals ditto except ms picky accepted brewer is yeast powder dulled all appetites a bit all accepted barley cat greenfoods powder effective on mom cat others liked except drs foster smith tuna treats ground to powder effective on mom cat all others liked bonito sprinkles cat man doo even more effective ditto dingo anchovy fillets ground to powder ditto effect acceptance tropical fish food sergeants atlantis ditto except ms picky liked normals not purina whisker lickins tender moments chicken flavor best effect acceptance whiskas temptations treats crumbled by hand best effect acceptance most of the products were accepted by most of our cats but their appetites were not helped noticeably until i found the last seven barley cat separate review drs f s tuna treats cat man doo bonito sprinkles reviewed here dingo anchovy fillets tropical fish food i did not test the regular or beta but ingredients were similar and loaded with fillers and dyes no reason to suspect that the brand is critical purina whisker lickins tender moments and whiskas temptations treats only regular salmon and chicken flavors tested only the whiskas temptations were effective to the point of bringing all our cats appetites back to the relish or enthusiastic stage none of the products were perfect most lacking in some degree of effectiveness or acceptance and the regular whiskas temptations the natural versions lacking in quality ingredients and difficult to crush by hand i have avoided brands like whiskas for years on nutritional and ethical grounds but i will reluctantly use them in a flavor enchancer role until i find a more suitable alternative three of our four cats had weird responses to the tropical fish flakes our two normals were absolutely repulsed and our ms picky licked her bowl clean go figure the cat man doo cmd sprinkles i bought from healthypets com for just a bit less than the price on amazon these are the only dehydrated bonito in sprinkles form there is a tuna dash product out there but more expensive that i could find other bonito products typically are large flakes and more expensive although the cmd product comes in a shaker jar it is not a sprinkles form like salt or pepper and does not shake out as easily or evenly the sprinkles are still flakes just a lot smaller if you decide to further reduce the size of any of the products it is not necessary to pulverize them to a fine powder generally they come out of a shaker container a little more uniformly if left slightly course the whiskas treats because of their soft center are best crumbled by hand the whiskas products present the best value about servings for about on sale at petco and a bit less at walmart purina whisker lickens come in several flavor varieties and though equally effective contain about servings and are more expensive even on amazons best terms multi pack and free shipping purina wl oz would have to sell for under per pack off the shelf or with free shipping to be competitive i found several of the products drsf s sergeants purina wl and whiskas at a discount store biglots among the dried fish products the cmd sprinkles do offer good value about per ounce before shipping taxes and provide so many servings that i could not attempt to count or even estimate if your pet gets turned on by cmd then because of the prodigious number of servings the cmd could be the better value a word of caution on the cmd quantity the listings and ads stated that the sprinkles jar contains oz not true the company used a fluid ounce volume measure rather than a weight measure for this particular product the sprinkles jar contains at least oz by weight even so the price still beats other brands of bonito and tuna products that i ran across credit to the company however since they packed the jar about as full as possible and they responded positively to my complaint about the choice of measures and confirmed that the labels ads and other marketing materials will be changed asap to state the oz weight measure will they pack the jar as tight cat man doo also is introducing a chicken sprinkles product oz size i wonder would our ms picky take to that conclusion effective appetite enhancers are out there and probably one that matches the pickiest weirdest of tastes the problem as i discovered is finding it as far as i can tell there is no logic no rhyme no reason to use as a guide individual differences among cats seems to be the norm and consistency of preferences does not appear to be of any evolutionary value cases in point our ms picky she does not like flavors of meat and fish but loved the food flakes for fish our normals who rarely refuse anything were sorely offended by the same offering personally we now have reasonably priced go to flavor enhancers for all our cats whiskas temptations and back ups cat man doo sprinkles for all as well even ms picky side note i powdered and combined the dingo anchovy product and the cat man doo sprinkles which suggests that other closely effective products may be mixed successfully i did it just to use down the anchovies since they are relatively expensive and i probably would not purchase them at full retail price so until their tastes change again we are no longer actively searching for appetite boosters hope this review helps with products or ideas anyone else even dog companions who is still searching for a pet appetite enhancer update and their tastes did change repeatedly and i acquired a whole new perspective after trying over four dozen flavor additives over the past year there are two approaches to re stimulating pet appetites on food or in the pet that is from the outside in or the inside out i was taking the wrong approach assuming that all i had to do was find the right product to add to my cats food and valla problem solved the following are my personal conclusions after many months and conversations with several vets diminished appetite may be difficult to distinguish from strong preferences picky picky and preference changes normally healthy pets experience swings in appetite like seasonal or during hairball buildup and do not need extra appetite stimulants or treats although you would never guess that from the explosion of treats on pet food aisles even pets that play or perform only expect approval attention and affection everyday pet feed should provide an adequate level of sensory interest if not then find an appropriate formula or mix of brands and wet dry that does affordability may be an issue but treats are not cheap and i have not done the math to get a fix on the pricepoint at which treats would become more expensive in any event off the shelf enhancers treats may have a role in case of genetic or age related sensory loss as a short term aid as a palliative after a rough experience day or as a last resort pets with known or suspected medical issues may need the inside out approach additive appetite enhancers may not be much help if the reduction in appetite is due to a medical case the short term benefit from even the best appetite additives anywhere from one meal to several months may be long enough to keep them going while the underlying medical issues and related appetite symptoms are resolved or not some inside out rx appetite enhancers also may only work short term maybe up to weeks others may work if administered continually the best but not typical outcome would be a jumpstart of the pet is natural appetite pets on a special diet like calorie restriction or rx have fewer choices of feed and may benefit from added outside in appetite enhancers to even the most palatable available special diet formulas expect short term results and anticipate having to cycle through various enhancer products frequently one reason for the loss of magic of appetite enhancers is pet intelligence they may eventually figure out that they can cherry pick the tasty additive and leave the relatively unappetizing food or wait out your first offering in anticipation of tastier follow up offerings but the flavor additives work better as sprinkles and tend to lose their magic if mixed in with the food i found this to be the case even if i marianated their regular food with the flavor enhancer in water prior to meals i have used the phrases flavor enhancer and appetite stimulant interchangeably there probably is a substantive difference but my interest was the end result a hearty interest in meals and increased consumption for those readers who are interested in further lists of products i have tried i set out the items i have researched used since the last report they are organized a little differently hopefully in a more useful fashion besides the specific items you may find the list helpful in generating further ideas to experiment with unless noted otherwise the off the shelf products were crumbled or pulverized if not already in powder form prior consultation with your vet would be advisable if not required for the inside out types and may prove helpful before venturing even into the realm of off the shelf and diy flavor enhancers the inside out types do not depend on the senses but work internally if at all to stimulate appetite vitamin dexamethasone rx injectable steriod pro biotics depo medrol rx injectable anti inflammatory pre biotics mirtazipine rx anti depressant pills exercise

four cats but were not particularly effective as appetite stimulants in our trials your pets especially the healthy ones may respond more favorably if i were starting over what would i do supplementing my perspective points above here are my main tips get to know my pets taste preferences in advance of any need check for medical causes if no medical issues switch to the other form dry wet of the pet is regular food and try as a flavor enhancer topping and or as a substitute then try warming or browning the wet version of the pet is regular food next your best choice of a treat or supplement with the pet is favorite flavor used as a topping then one with a liver taste such as barley cat or pet greens freeze dried then cat man do bonito sprinkles natural balance platefuls catty shack treats purina whisker lickins or whiskas temptations if a product meets with initial acceptance withhold judgment on effectiveness until after a few meals worth of experiences forego trying all the hundreds of treats in search of the one that will work after you have gone thru your best shots if there are medical issues consider off the shelf and rx appetite stimulants singly or in combination if a liquid meal substitute is called for consider rebound and clinicare rf but also catsure and kmr and as a last resort human versions of liquid renal failure products acceptance at this point will likely be a major issue but at least they are there for the trying my apologies for the awkward columns but i could not figure out a neat way to compress the information hope all this helps and good luck
