this is the perfect blend of spice and sweet it transformed my steak and mushrooms into something magical this is so easy to fix just brown the meat and veggies mushrooms in my case remove from pan and mix coconut powder with sauce and cup water i used a and filled it to about below the rim another reviewer mentioned that the coconut powder is difficult to mix in using a whisk solved this issue and i was able to whisk everything together in a matter of seconds after everything is mixed together add the meat and veggies back into the pan and bring to a boil another reviewer mentioned the tough vegetable pieces leaves i noticed that too but cooking it a couple minutes longer solved that issue i think that this might just be the easiest tastiest dish i have ever had i am anxious to try the other varieties of prima taste kits.
