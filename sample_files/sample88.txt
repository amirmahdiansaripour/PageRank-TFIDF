this is the kind of garbage food that gives paleo primal a bad name whenever you see the words gluten free on a product label you should immediately be skeptical of the time you will want to run away screaming at the top of your lungs cause it is not only about gluten it is about blood sugar spikes if you care about your pancreas which you can not live without and not becoming or staying diabetic you should care about this look at the ingredient list ingredientsmanioc tapioca flour modified manioc starch manioc iodine free sea salt basil garlic onion oregano manufactured in a gluten free environment allergen information contains no wheat no soy no corn no rice no potato no yeast no nuts no peanuts no lactose no casein those first two ingredients are garbage carbs you do not want to eat no matter what tapioca starch will spike your insulin faster than a snickers bar faster even than two slices of whole wheat bread no need to investigate further but say you are still curious let is go to the chebe website here is where the real tale is told the box contains servings at grams each however you use the entire box to make one pizza crust that is grams of pure processed carbs with zero nutritional value in one pizza crust which is only a medium size pie the other ingredients you add to the crust mix are negligible carb wise but you still look at them gram cup shredded grams if you grate it yourself from hard aged cheese the pre grated store cheeses are coated with potato starch and do add some carbs whole grams grams so grams are added to the pie and now let is say you top it with tomato sauce part skim mozzarella and some veggies since a pizza is not just a crust even without calculating precisely how much you are using it is a good bet that you are adding another or so carb grams thus your medium pizza pie will have grams of carbs or total you eat half the pie that is grams of carbs if you are trying to lose weight that is more than two days worth of carbs if you are trying to keep your blood sugar stable you just blew that too to lose weight eating grain free the rule of thumb is no more than about carb grams per day no more than about net carbs carbohydrate fiber net carb grams per sitting and that is how you evaluate a gluten free label or you could buy the product make it test your fasting sugar with a glucometer right before eating then again an hour later to see firsthand what it is doing to you the average healthy non diabetic person will zoom from about to within an hour then it will take another several hours after that to get back down to around do that once a day or several times per day for a few years and your problems will be over because then you can start injecting insulin into your belly with a syringe before each meal and eat whatever you want and once again the food industry and big pharma win to me that is just sad and the antithesis of paleo primal eating i love pizza i eat it all the time and i eat a low carb high fat diet in a few months my triglycerides went from to and i am no longer pre diabetic that never would have happened if i were preparing meals using commercial mixes like this there are dozens of reputable low carb grain free recipe blogs and websites out there with pizza crusts made from cheese eggs flax meal nut flours cauliflower or even just sausage meatz pizza that are just as easy to make as this one from a processed mix that hew to the spirit of paleo primal eating and are far healthier to boot
