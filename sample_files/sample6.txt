i have never reviewed an item before but taking the time to review the baby brezza because of the unfortunate experiences i have had with this product and to warn people not to spend on such a poorly made product i read multiple reviews on the baby brezza and read some negative reviews about the blade not working but i tend to go with positive reviews if they outweigh the negative ones but from now on i will definitely reconsider buying anything with negative reviews and the baby brezza purchase has actually discouraged me from buying anything from amazon that is expensive and can be broken as you cannot return the product after days i bought the bb in february and should have returned it right away after i had some problems from the beginning but i was too excited to use it so i did the cover never fit quite right the manual said that the blade has two positions up for steaming and down for blending and obviously up if you are going to steam blend but it did not seem like the blade had positions and i always had to readjust the cover to make it fit turning the blade slightly down from the up position so the cover would close and i bought the grain basket accesory and it never fit the cover just would not close it was much too tall that should have been the final indication that i had a defective bb but it was so much trouble to return the product to customer service and i just played phonetag with them i was still able to use it for the purposes i wanted to steam and blend fruits and veggies so i just kept using it for a while til the final third thing the whole thing just broke the driveshaft and blade just popped off one time blade just would not turn called customer service terrible experince except for one rep that was really nice whom i had been playing phonetag with before i talked to the rep i really liked the two i spoke with including the manager were rude and unhelpful granted i called when i was upset and was probably mean myself but i thought customer service people is job is to make the customer happy which i learned at years old at my first job at a restaurant they argued with me displayed frustration even mild anger with their voice as well as impatience when i asked if i can get a full refund they said i would have to return the product and wait for it to be inspected and maybe i will get a refund they also said that i could not get a refund on the grain basket as they do not give refunds for accesories and the first rep even argued with me asking if i had left the blade in when i put in the grain basket which is impossible to do if you wanted to put in the grain basket at the same time so i asked to speak with the rep i had been playing phonetag with and she was really nice patient and tried to keep her customer happy she offered to send a new baby brezza without me sending in the broken one a new grain basket that she said she would make sure it fit and another free accesory of my choice the new bb along with the other two products came quickly few days and so i was a happy customer again the new one i received is different from the one i originally bought the blade was a different color more brown instead of orange the driveshaft lock at the bottom of the pitcher was configured diffrently and the blade had definite positions up and down the cover fit perfect and the grain basket fit but guess this time the blade was broken it still works but the top part that twists comes off which i didnt think was a big deal as it still worked but when i was cleaning it the bottom with the blade part fell off and almost hit my dog i checked the old bb i had and the top of the blade did not come off so i called the nice rep again she sent me a new pitcher driveshaft and blade she did not send me any new accessories for my trouble when i asked but she was still very nice i did tell her that this new bb is a lot better than my first one and she said the one i have is from a different line so their product is not even got it the mail today the top of the blade still came off i left a message with the nice rep again but this is now ridiculous my baby is one year old and i dont even use it as much anymore so hence why i am writing this review save your money and trouble and get a steamer and a handheld blender to make babyfood oh i used the grain basket to make small sized pasta like it suggests not big size pasta it came out like paste all stuck together and i made same pasta in a saucepan in mins and it was fine grain basket took mins and pasta was one solid pasty mess when it was done so just boil pasta in a saucepan originally gave it two stars for the nice rep but changing it to one star if it was not so cheap and a poorly made product with all the malfunctions i would have been happy with it should have gotten the beaba fron william and sonoma maybe they at least would take back a broken product without me packing it in a box going to usps spending money to get my back or they should only charge for the bb not or have the accesories go with it for free i guess that is what you may get with products made in china addendum my husband just told me that he noticed there is water leaking in the back when it is on steam mode when the first one did not do that it seems like the second bb we have has a new set of problems when i decided to buy the brezza earlier this year there were only a few one star reviews compaining it did not work i just read the current ones and there are so many one star reviews complaining of the same defects i experienced or different ones that really scare me like oil leaking that i donot want to use this product anymore i would not have bought it if i was reading the same reviews back when i decided to buy it i am going to call amazon to see if they can issue me the refund it is near impossible to get a live person on the brezza customer service and they do call back but it takes a while and it is so incovenient and with a product like this that you use a lot for only a limited amount of time when baby eats babyfood it is really a rip off to not just send someone a replacement right away planning to call amazon to see if they can take a look of how many complaints there are of this defective product and not sell this product anymore it is a disservice to loyal customers of amazon makes me want to stick to brick and mortar stores so you do not have the inconvenience and frustration of not getting a refund or a replacement immediately maybe for some people is nothing but for us was an investment of a product i was planning to use well into my baby is toddler years to sneak in pureed vegetables in their spaghetti sauce like the bb site advertises cannot do that with a poorly made product that is only on warranty for a year.
