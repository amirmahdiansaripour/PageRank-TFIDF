this is a staple item for me i can not say enough great things about it it is a good source of fiber and protein low calorie love this stuff i typically add agave nectar or organic maple syrup as a sweetener i also use chopped walnuts banana cinnamon dates raisins and chopped apples it is terrific by itself but it is a real treat with any of the other ingredients i listed added to it
