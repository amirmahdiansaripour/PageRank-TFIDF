note i am discussing the packaging and shipping issues here because i was not able to do so via amazon is special feedback section for packaging and shipping and there is no way to contact deals on call llc that i can find but i wanted them to be aware of this it is also relevant as it affects the product you may purchase for yourself or others especially if you are having it shipped as a gift to others i am taking the time to write this to give you information you may want and to save you time had researched this product online as i had seen it mentioned with praise on several tv shows as a gift for my many bacon loving friends was a bit concerned about whether or not it required special packaging cooling etc during shipping after reading some comments here on amazon and elsewhere my personal experience with items that require any sort of special cooling etc is that stuff arrives in unusable state this is often the fault of the carrier fedex ups etc rather than the manufacturer or shipper called the company in seattle skillet street food and asked whether the product required cooling refrigerating during shipment answer no information was not on website had also sent an email suggesting they add that information and the nutritional content on their web site when it comes to food products you can never have too much information i was surprised that i had not found it in the info about the product in the amazon listing either i then ordered the three pack cheapest option price wise paid for next day delivery and it arrived in less than hours excellent opened the smallish box now given the size of the three jars and the box there was not enough of those packing pillows to hold it in place and it was clear that the three jars placed inside a simple plastic bag and not fixed in place via any method had moved around during shipping plastic jars not damaged but they easily could have been from hitting each other during handling etc the first thing i wanted to check was the seals as my research said that if the seal is broken the product has been compromised and you cannot eat it see info to come from the company well the lid on one of the jars was open and loose there was some greasy film around the rim of the jar and when i opened it half of the seal was open and the jam was coming out now this is actually good news it alerted me that the jar had been compromised and i immediately tossed it the seals on the other two jars were fine no film lids secure called amazon customer service and explained what happened it was unclear to me who had handled packed and shipped the actual order amazon or deals on call llc still not sure i requested a replacement jar which they could not do but they did refund me the entire amount so i could reorder another three jars which i will do it is still unclear when the seal came open and what caused it because of what i do in my real life i am a stickler about health and safety issues since it was unclear as to who did the actual handling packing and shipping of the bacon jam jars for this order and i could not contact the vendor deals on call llc directly to relay the problem about what may have happened in shipping i did ask amazon to do so and i am sharing it here but i went a step further because this is the product of a small biz in seattle and having seen the web site for the company where they actively solicit feedback i thought it made sense to alert them to this issue so they could possibly alert the folks who buy from them to be aware that seals could come open after the product left skillet street foods and was handled elsewhere retail etc when i reached them no annoying voicemail but an actual person responsible for the product who was professional and courteous the person explained how units are checked individually to ensure seals are secure before they are lidded and sent on their way he also knew the vendor associated with this amazon purchase and could vouch for their reliable and professional service which i assumed given their high ratings on amazon more importantly he said he would discuss the packaging issuesnet net seals can open but this is apparently rare you should be alert if the seal is open air has gotten into the jar and the jam should not be eaten this could explain why some folks have had an issue with the taste while others are raving about the jam jars are shelf stable until open once open they must be refrigerated there is a use by date on the bottom of each jar you can freeze the jam if not opened and used by that date good to know again this information is not on the skillet street web site that i could find as of this writing and not here on amazon posting it should be added along with the nutritional information and ingredients this is what is on the jar itself store it in the fridge serve it at room temp and use or freeze by date printed on bottom of container fyi just reading that wording it is unclear whether store it in the fridge applies to when you receive it or after you open it perhaps the wording should be revised so it says refrigerate after opening as so many labels do to differentiate from those that require no special handling or those that say keep refrigerated one should never assume that it is clear example we buy pickles in a jar they are shelf stable until we ordered a new kind imagine our surprise when opening several days later they were off our bad because we had not read the packaging which said keep refrigerated it was delivered with other groceries when we were not at home or we might have noted that it was with the refrigerated items in our order not the canned bottled items nutritional data serving size ounceservings per container from fat fat g saturated fat mg mg carb dietary fiber uncured bacon no nitrite or nitrate added except those naturally occuring in celery powder pork prepared with water salt turbinado sugar celery powder lactic acid starter culture not from milk onion balsamic vinegar organic wine vinegar from juice of organic grapes organic concentrated grape must organic caramel sugar brown sugar sugar invert sugar cane molasses water salt pepper fyi that concentrated grape must is not a typo i will google this as i am now curious what must is i can not speak to the taste of this as these are gifts however once my recipients report back i will add this feedback very impressed by skillet street foods as the creater manufacturer of the jam who appears genuinely interested in improving all aspects of product and delivery and as always very pleased that amazon could deal with the problem quickly and easily would have been happy with just a replacement jar but amazon went the extra mile hope that the nutritional information and ingredients and the details about usage will be added to the skillet street food online shop and to any listing posting where this product is sold i am actually surprised that this information is not readily available a few friends told me that they will never order any food product without first seeing this information which means everyone is losing sales when a product like this is offered without the details plus lots of folks might miss out on what many say is an incredibly tasty and versatile jam
