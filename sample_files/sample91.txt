the tale had been around almost as long as time itself from herodotus to prester john to juan ponce de leon many a great man foretold of the legend of the mythical fountain of youth our journey is at the behest of that rotten scoundrel sir algernon freeman mitford had taken us from the coast of ethiopia during the second italo abyssinian war to the shores of bimini to the swampland of florida still the mythical fountain of youth eluded us however it was during the great exploration during the spring of and a chance encounter with an village elder within the peaceful arawak people of hispaniola that we received our finest intel on the location of the elusive fountain of youth at first we believed we lacked the communicative arts to converse with the village elder until we located a young arawak woman who understood rudimentary spanish a truly coarse and barbaric language romance language nothing as all knows the most romantic language of all being english the language of kings thankfully helmsman constance was in the employ of the h m s peregrine cavendish helmsman constance as fine a helmsman and navigator in all all his majesty is seas was also a finely educated cambridge gentleman with a truly exemplary ear for foreign languages helmsman constance considered himself fluent in the barbaric language of the spaniards much of it learned after a torrid love affair with eulalia de asis de la piedad daughter of queen isabella ii of spain while she was married to infante antonio duke of galliera a true rogue that helmsman constance helmsman constance turned to the young arawak woman and said como el viejo donde la fuente de la juventud es the young arawak woman turned to the elderly arawak elder listened contently and then said to helmsman constance l dice que si la fuente de la juventud es lo que buscas entonces tenga cuidado porque es realmente peligroso pero tiene que viajar al oeste m s all del gran oc ano occidental por la legendaria isla de fiji s lo entonces una vez que usted bebe las aguas m s puras de fiji se reciba su fuente de la juventud helmsman constance turned to me and said the woman says for the fountain of youth we must find fiji and drink the water of fiji so pure with that the h m s peregrine cavendish set a course and began the daunting voyage ahead to truly the ends of the earth captain if i may permission to speak freely boson is mate micklegal asked granted i responded i do not have a good feeling about this captain i can not explain it the boys have heard stories stories of this island of fiji they say a great warlord is there one of them ancient warlords you know with special powers they call him ratu seru epenisa cakobau call him the centipede because they say he moves silently and strikes painfully i hear your concerns boson is mate micklegal and i share some of them but we are englishmen of the finest character we have honour courage and valour if sir algernon freeman mitford has asked this of us then we must obey boson is mate micklegal then pulled out his trusty kettle and brewed us a fine cup of earl grey as all fine englishmen know earl grey is the the finest of all teas the earl is truly the tea of kings we arrived on the the island of fiji after many fortnights a most beautiful and stunning visage such a tropical paradise one cannot imagine how such a dastardly action such as cannibalism can exist in such a pristine and wonderful paradise but we came for the fountain of youth the waters of fiji you see friends the waters of fiji had been untouched by man far from pollution far from acid rain far from industrial waste they say the waters of fiji are drawn from an artesian aquifer located at the very edge of a primitive rainforest hundreds of miles away from the nearest continent the wonderful aroma of island mango peach recalls such vivid memories as we traveled through the rainforest being ever so careful to avoid the centipede we were drawn in by the luscious scents of the mango is and peaches of the island boson is mate micklegal made sure to gather these delicious fruits and then we saw a bright light the fountain of youth it had to be we pushed through the dense vegetation and arrived at the natural artesian aquifer there we saw the centipede who appeared much younger and calm than we figured him to be he spoke with nary an accent and in perfectly understandable english cannibalism aside a non englishman with such fine command of the language of kings deserves a frothy pint my friends welcome to fiji and welcome to the fountain of youth you see reality is a bit more complicated some waters come right out of municipal reservoirs before they are purified and even spring water is affected by the earth is many pollutants as it bubbles to the surface then there is fiji water uncontaminated and uncompromised preserved and protected by its source and location fiji water is aquifer is in a virgin ecosystem at the edge of a primitive rainforest a continent away from the nearest industrialized civilization our rainfall is purified by equatorial winds after traveling thousands of miles across the pacific ocean winds that carry acid rain and pollutants to other parts of the planet just do not come our way but you can never remove the water from fiji he said for it is the lifeline of my people the centipede offered us a few kilograms of mangos and peaches which he humbly accepted he then offered us the bounty of a recent dutch expedition to which we politely accepted back on the ship as in customary fashion boson is mate micklegal whipped up a fine cup of tea he mixed white tea leaves green tea leaves in the essence of the island mangos and peaches and the result was mesmerizing boson is mate micklegal is finest creation to date we celebrated as boson is mate micklegal slipped below deck into the hold he pulled out the bottle of glen fiddych stored in the hold took an enormous swig and toasted himself however in his drunken stupor boson is mate micklegal falsely believed the h m s peregrine was under attack by a portuguese vessel loaded the peaches and mangoes into the number cannon and fired away awakening the entire ship for breakfast i asked boson is mate micklegal for another cup of the fine tea from the day previous confused and knowing the lack of the delicious island peaches and mangoes boson is mate micklegal found lemongrass and leaves of orange from our journey to new zealand three months prior and passed it off as the delicious island mango and peach tea as we were all hungover we neary realized the difference so to the hack is at lipton while the taste of this island mango and peach tea is mightily unpleasant the thought and memories it conjures are truly unique all hail lipton hack is
