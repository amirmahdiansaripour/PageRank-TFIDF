the body is protective response to injuries infections and other irritants but long term low grade inflammation puts you at risk of serious conditions like heart disease and diabetes tart cherries amazing potential to lower disease risknow new research reported on at the experimental biology annual meeting in california adds even more evidence to support cherries ability to alleviate inflammation in one study overweight or obese men and women were provided with ounces of tart cherry juice or a placebo beverage daily for four weeks the results were encouraging participants drinking the cherry juice showed significant reductions in known markers of inflammation and lower levels of triglycerides blood fats and ldl cholesterol both known risk factors for heart disease researcher dr mitch seymour who led an animal study at the university of michigan in which tart cherries were again found to lower inflammation said chronic inflammation is a whole body condition that can affect overall health especially when it comes to the heart this study offers further promise that foods rich in antioxidants such as cherries could potentially reduce inflammation and have the potential to lower disease risk to start with tart cherries can aid muscle recovery following exercise a study published in the british journal of sports medicine revealed that strength loss and pain following exercise were significantly less in the cherry juice trial compared to the placebo trial most notably strength loss averaged over the four days after exercise was per cent with the placebo but only per cent with the cherry juice drinkers several earlier studies have confirmed that tart cherries offer benefits for patients with autoimmune neurodegenerative and connective tissue diseases particularly rheumatoid arthritis and diabetes studies show that tart cherries not only reduce pain and inflammation but also offer protection against cancer these effects are attributed to the high amounts of plant phytochemicals known as anthocyanins they contain research has shown that a diet containing cherries is beneficial in reducing the risk of colon cancer when researchers fed a diet containing tart cherries anthocyanins or cyanidin a non sugar breakdown product of anthocyanins to mice with a genetic susceptibility to colon cancer the animals developed significantly fewer and smaller colon tumours this study also revealed that these compounds effectively reduced the growth of two human colon cancer cell lines the cancer protective benefits of this fruit were validated in another experimental study in which cherry fruit extract reduced the growth of both human colon cancer cells and human breast cancer cells in a dose dependent fashion researchers have suggested that a possible mechanism by which cherries may confer these benefits is through shutting down the growth of cancer cells by depriving them of the proteins they need to grow supporting melatonin levels and brain healthtart cherries are one of the few food sources of melatonin a chemical released in the body by the pineal gland that is closely connected with the regulation of the sleep wake cycle melatonin also acts as a powerful antioxidant providing neuro protective and immune modulating effects ongoing scientific studies are demonstrating how foods naturally rich in melatonin like montmorency cherries can help sufferers of insomnia gain deep restful sleep tart cherries are also rich in phenolic compounds which have strong neuro protective activity in a laboratory setting cherry phenolics protected neuronal cells from cell damaging oxidative stress in a dose dependent manner tart cherry compounds may therefore play an important role in protecting ageing adults against neurodegenerative conditions such as memory loss senile dementia and perhaps even alzheimer is disease give it to me why do people use tart cherries and tart cherry juice both sweet and tart cherries and cherry juice have long been used by traditional healers as a folk remedy for gout because cherries are thought to lower urate levels in the body tart cherries are used for conditions involving inflammation and pain such as arthritis gout muscle pain back pain diabetes neurodegenerative diseasesboth sweet and tart cherries contain phenolics naturally occurring plant compounds that have anti inflammatory antioxidant effects the main type of phenolic in cherries is called anthocyanins in general the darker the cherry color the higher the anthocyanin content anthocyanins have been found to block two enzymes and which play a role in the production of inflammatory compounds called prostaglandins aspirin and nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs nsaids such as naproxen and ibuprofen also work this way in test tube studies cherry anthocyanins have been found to protect neurons from damage by oxidative stress however there have been no studies that have looked at whether cherry extracts could prevent or slow the progression of neurodegenerative diseases such as alzheimer is disease or parkinson is disease in humans both balaton and montmorency tart cherries contain relatively high levels of the antioxidant melatonin compared to other foods montmorency cherries contain approximately times more melatonin than do balaton cherries are tart cherries more effective than sweet cherries generally tart cherries have been found to have higher concentrations of phenolics and anthocyanins than sweet cherries tart cherries are also slightly lower in sugar half a cup of sweet cherries contains g of sugar and calories compared to g of sugar and calories in tart cherries however there is no real evidence that these differences are significant both types of cherries are very high in anthocyanins compared with other foods it may be that we are hearing more about the health benefits of tart cherries because of the way they are marketed in the us food and drug administration sent warning letters to cherry farmers and distributors for positioning tart cherries on their websites as a medicinal food that could possibly help people with gout arthritis diabetes and prevent cancer what research has been done on tart cherries although anthocyanins which are also found in blueberries and other purplish red fruits and vegetables are known to be powerful antioxidants no studies have looked at whether cherries tart or sweet can relieve symptoms of arthritis gout or diabetes outside the lab all studies involving cherries have been very small so we will have to wait to see whether tart cherries are beneficial and in what quantities in the meantime here are a few of the studies that have been conducted so far a small randomized controlled trial in the british journal of sports medicine examined the effectiveness of a tart cherry juice blend in preventing symptoms of exercise induced muscle damage fourteen male college students drank fl oz of a cherry juice blend or a placebo twice per day for eight consecutive days strength loss was significantly lower in people taking the cherry juice compared with the placebo pain was also significantly lower in people taking the cherry juice jill m tall ph d research fellow at johns hopkins was the lead researcher of a study that tested the effectiveness of orally administrated anthocyanins from tart cherries on inflammation induced pain in rats the results of the study suggested that tart cherry anthocyanins may have a beneficial role in reducing inflammatory pain one small study published in the journal of nutrition supported the anti gout effectiveness of cherries assessed the effects of bing cherry a sweet cherry consumption on healthy women and found that cherry consumption decreased blood urate levels and there was a marginal decrease in inflammatory markers c reactive protein and nitric oxide.
