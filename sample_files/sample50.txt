first this drink illy issimo coffee drink caff cans pack of definitely tastes like coffee as opposed to say tea or ketchup or turkey gravy also because i am a bit of a coffee connoisseur grind my own beans ingeniously mix various varieties use a price erroras of this writing there is another error in the description you get cans for which is said to be cents per ounce but if you do the math you get quite a different result oh heck here let me do it for ounces time cans equals ounces times equals cents cents divided by ounces per equals exactly cents per ounce where the least significant digits repeat and also which the decimal portion of which is equal to exactly divided by which as if you did not know as we round that number to less and less precision we discover that the in the hundredths place forces the in the tenths place to round up to and if you round cents to some integral unit you are forced to round up to cents you may not round down to cents first this is just plain false advertising i find it interesting nay suspicious that the error just happens to be in the manufacturer is favor if you were to order a million cans of illy issimo coffee drink caff cans pack of that difference would make a difference and here is the proof a million cans at ounces per can ounces at the incorrect stated price of cents per ounce the total would be cents which is but in fact as i am sure you will remember the price is cents per ounce which results in a total price for a million cans of cents is a difference of a whopping i do not know about you but every time someone asks me whether i want a discount of nearly i always say that i very much do now i am not saying that if you place an order for a million cans of this product and promise to pay up front in cash the manufacturer will not consider offering you some sort of deal maybe throw in a free coca cola mouse pad or something i am just saying that the price per ounce as stated on the amazon description page is incorrect and i am curious as to why whatever the answer is i do not see how it can be satisfactory so first if you find out let me know by composing a comment at the bottom of this review caffeineaccording to the mayo clinic web site an can of red bull contains to milligrams of caffeine which i will hereby fearlessly average to mg divided by is mg per ounce the product under review contains mg of caffeine per can which works out to mg per ounce so the percentage by which illy issimo is more caffeinated is calculated like despite what any previous or future reviewer might putatively or may allegedly say or have said this illy issimo contains about more caffeine per ounce than red bull but first maybe we should be more interested in the total caffeine per can not per ounce because most people are not going to choose between drinking all of a can of illy issimo on the one hand and in er on the other hand drinking only of an can of red bull most people are going to drink all of whichever can they happen to have at hand if that is what we are measuring here is the mg mg mg is so close to that what this means is that you get the same number of milligrams of caffeine from a can of red bull as from a can of illy issimo the namespeaking of which the name illy issimo is multiply confusing first it does not have any capital letters which i secretly regard as presumptuous but for which i subtract no stars although in a better world i would it begs a typical speaker of english to think the first part of it refers the word ill which means you are sick i e you have some medical condition you wish you did not have which seems like a poor choice for the first name of a product designed for the sole purpose of being ingested into the body the whole word illy is indeed the legitimate if somewhat unusual adjectival form of that word ill illy means poorly or badly as in her review of that product was illy received by the manufacturer or more or less literally depending on how you interpret it he performed illy on his first autopsy that first word illy especially because it is uncapitalized begs native speakers of english to fill in a first letter and the choices are billy dilly filly hilly and silly i will tell you that the first possibility that popped into my own personal mind was silly with all these problems potentially in english speakers minds i my own personal self would have voted against the choice of the word illy to headline the name of this product or any other if i had been asked which i was not which is no doubt why it is named what it is which is no good reason to subtract any stars which i will not still kosher illy issimo coffee drink caff cans pack of is declared to be kosher certified first and most important that means if you restrict yourself to cans of coffee that have been kashered you may safely drink this product without risking any bad outcomes that would arise if you did not i do not know about you but i do not want my diet controlled by centuries dead people people who could not possibly have had access to all the information that is now available about foods and nutrition who espoused antediluvian rules that proscribe meat that comes from any animal that has cloven hoofs and does not ruminate which excludes from their prescribed diet such extraordinarily useful food as pigs that so many people in refuse to eat pork products is astonishing to me and i do not want my diet controlled by a rule that dairy products and meat may not meet which i am pretty sure rules out a properly prepared cheddar cheeseburger which i am pretty sure i will never rule out of my life as long as i can operate an outdoor grill or a simple stove i am sure i should by which i mean i am sure i should forgo the cheese but not for illy and capricious reasons but rather for health reasons but the point is that this product is kosher so if you care about that then you have my blessing to go nuts i award stars because this product delivers what it says it will unless you order a million cans in which case you are out you notice that eight times in the review above i started with first implying at some point a second but that i never delivered even once
