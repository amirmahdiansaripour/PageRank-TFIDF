the following review i wrote last week the title was better than so so without the awesome part which i just added in the week i have had the product i have found a new use that totally makes the product beyond spectacular at least for me so here is the original review oh at that time i gave it stars i bought this product based on a review in nutrition in action magazine supplemented by the positive reviews here having been in the army for years i am used to the unusual presentation of usual foods while i would still give this product a positive review you will not mistake this product for peanut butter yes it is peanut buttery convenient and calorie saving it is not however cheap and as a slim athletic guy i do not need to count calories so much so this will not be my go to product for pb i like the concept but realistically it has an unusual mouth feel somebody else said if you want to use it on a pb j sandwich you will be disappointed i agree also i was disappointed by putting it on celery and if you let it set out after mixing for an hour or so the texture becomes very set up still if you are craving a tablespoon of pb it is worth a try and the chocolate one is better kinda like mixing nutella with pb but not quite as good ok that was the original review i had tried the chocolate by itself and it does not have a huge chocolate taste but it is there anyway i decided to use the chocolate with celery and what a better stirrer than the celery stick anyway when the chocolate and celery comes together there is magic and it totally elevates this product to a new level the chocolate peanut butter placed in the celery rib after stirring is like eating chocolate frosting from the bowl without the guilt it is such a nutritious filling guilt free snack i am sold.
