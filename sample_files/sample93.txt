i have been feeding blue buffalo almost exclusively for about eight years now and could not be happier prior to switching to blue one of my cats who was twelve then was losing fur to a point where she was bald nearly everywhere that she could reach as she was licking and chewing constantly she looked like she had mange except i do not think that cats get mange i took her to a couple of veterinarians one insisted that she was overly sensitive to fleas although we were not finding any fleas that did not make sense to me since i had inspected her carefully and i knew that with five cats if one of them had fleas they would all have fleas another vet put her on steroids which seemed to help some except that it changed her personality and that was not something i was willing to leave her on for life then someone mentioned food allergies particularly to corn soy and wheat not knowing any better i had been feeding science diet which was recommended by the veterinarian i looked for something without corn soy and wheat at first i tried some other premium food and her fur started to grow back i tried a few different premium foods always making sure that they did not include corn soy or wheat some my cats liked better than others but i did not find any that all of my cats liked learning more about feline nutrition i began looking at what the foods did have in them as well as what they did not have when i came across blue buffalo the idea of the life source bits made sense to me we began feeding blue to our cats and all of them loved it my wife came across one of the blue representatives in a petco store and she and i both ended up working for blue for a few years both in maine and in north carolina it was nice to be able to represent a product that i believed in entirely i no longer work for blue but i continue to feed blue buffalo to my cats the only kibble that they eat is made by blue buffalo and about fifty percent of their canned food is also made by blue three of my cats are twenty one now and a fourth is ten years old the fifth died of cancer when she was a few months short of twenty four years old given the age of my three older cats i am a little more concerned about their hydration now than before so i feed them more canned food than i would if they were younger they appreciate variety in their canned food so i mix some other brands of premium canned food whose ingredients i approve of even with the canned food however all of my cats like the blue buffalo selections and at least one of my cats will turn away from nearly every other brand that i have tried the exception being petco is premium house brand soulistic which has good ingredients and all of my cats like it i rarely feed them kibble other than blue although i alternate between the blue buffalo kibble selections from time to time my cats never tire of blue buffalo and i would not want to be without the good results that i have seen from it all three of my twenty one year old cats are healthy and active veterinarians who have not seen them before invariably guess their ages as being a third to a fourth of what their ages really are one of them has arthritis but you would never know it as long as she is taking her supplement another reason for feeding them canned food each day since i can hide the supplement in the canned food other than that they have no issues whatsoever they play they fight and they climb being cats of course they also sleep a lot their fur is beautiful even the one who was once bald here is another huge plus one that i was not allowed to talk about while i was representing blue buffalo although my cats are allowed to go outside whenever they want to in maine it is not as if they are playing in the street i have not had a problem with fleas since i began feeding them blue buffalo this has been true even in summers when neighbors are complaining about fleas being a particular problem if they are outside in the summer i take sensible precautions and comb them out frequently particularly if i see one of them scratching but i have not seen more than three fleas in eight years my cats are not treated with poisons either blue buffalo is not a remedy for fleas but good nutrition assists the cat is natural defenses i believe one thing that many people are concerned about when considering blue buffalo or another premium brand of cat food is the price yes you will pay more per pound for blue buffalo than you would for a store brand when you look beyond that you will see the cost savings however cats do not digest corn soy or wheat very well when you feed a cheaper cat food and even some of the more expensive brands that consists mostly of stuff they can not digest much of what you are paying for ends up in the litter box i can assure you that my litter boxes do not fill nearly as quickly now as they did when i was feeding science diet to my cats and what is in there does not smell as bad the last time i checked science diet was even more expensive than blue buffalo whatever you are feeding your cats if the chief ingredients are corn soy wheat or something else that is not meat poultry or fish you might consider that you are feeding the litter box so you should add in the extra cost of cat litter i do not know how many people i have come across who talk about their cats half the age of my own as being old many people are paying high veterinary bills for health problems that may not be necessary if they were eating a healthier diet with three twenty one year old cats and one ten year old my cats see the veterinarian rarely and only for preventative checkups even the one with arthritis is successfully treated with cosequin an over the counter supplement that i buy here on amazon com i will not go so far as to say that blue buffalo is the only cat food that you should feed to your cat in canned foods there are several other good choices some of which i buy as treats for those of my cats who like them there are other dry cat foods that use real meat as the first ingredient and which avoid corn soy and wheat my cats prefer blue and i think there is something to be said for the life source bits that are found only in blue that is my opinion and i am sticking to it
