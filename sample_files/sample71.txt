my daughter has celiac is disease so i purchased this product to use as a substitute for bisquick baking mix it was not as easy as i hoped to mix up with the crisco for the recipe i was using it for an impossible pie however once i was able to finally mix it together with the other ingredients it turned out fairly well and we all enjoyed the ham and swiss pie have not had the opportunity to use it for other baking uses as of yet
