april cheez its from sunshine biscuits which is owned by kellogg is are advertised on the box as being creamy mild if by creamy is meant that there is a texture that is creamy then this half of the creamy and mild claim is false these are crackers and they have been intentionally baked so as to remove water they are crisp throughout they do not deform in response to sufficient pressure but rather they crack which i think is why crackers are called that they are not a liquid in any sense they are a quite dry solid and to me a texture that is described as creamy must be to some extent liquid which these are not at all brie is a creamy cheese cheddar is not speaking of cheeses these crackers contain three types the one listed first on the list of ingredients is white cheddar followed by cheddar and only then by mozzarella and they are mild there is no burst of cheese or any other flavor when you pop a few in your mouth and crunch down so the second half of the creamy and mild claim is accurate i am sure we are all different but for me the biggest hit of flavor is just before i crunch down try it just before you start chewing them take a sniff through your mouth and nose and you will smell a lovely odor of cheese you probably want to know why the manufacturer is called sunshine biscuits the company was founded by one jacob l loose of kansas city missouri who with the profits it generated built and lived in what is now called the loose mansion which is quite an extraordinary property on the south side of armour boulevard just east of main street which you can google it is a good three stories tall and comes equipped not just with walk in closets but a walk in safe a carriage house a kitchen bigger than a two car garage and more rooms than you can count no kidding for several years the loose mansion was owned by my aunt sue is not for profit educational enterprise called the teel foundation and during that time it was used for some of the scenes in the movie truman starring gary sinise and from which it the foundation benefitted because the movie crew left behind a really nice and really huge table that was used in scenes where truman is cabinet met so if you want to see that table you will have to watch the movie and the reason i say i am not kidding that it has more rooms than you can count is that sue owned and operated her foundation from that mansion for over a year before she realized there were rooms she had never once entered this is a very big house anyway jacob who also funded one of the finest parks in kansas city called loose park was married to a woman named sunshine so now you know you also probably want to know just exactly how many of these kellogg is sunshine cheez it mozzarella cheese pack of by cheez it crackers you can buy for one share of berkshire hathaway stock i have read all the previous reviews of this product to date and i see no mention whatsoever of any attempt even to ask this question not to mention answering it so let me fill in that hole for you because as you know from so many of my own previous reviews on amazon i do strive to be thorough as of the close of business on the new york stock exchange on april berkshire hathaway class a shares ticker symbol brka are worth each that is right it will cost you over to buy just one share of berkshire by comparison one share of kellogg is ticker symbol k at the april close will cost you weighed ten of these crackers and arrived at ounce i added ten more and arrived at ounce so we can be pretty sure each cracker weighs pretty close to of an ounce the inverse of is which means there are crackers per ounce there being ounces of crackers per box we now know there are crackers per box now we need to know the price of such a box and here i get confused according to the amazon page i am looking at right now a pack of four of these boxes costs which is per box which seems like a lot to me when i just now used google goggles on the upc bar code i was led to a store selling these for which is the price rounded up to that i will use in the remaining divided by means you can buy boxes and have a dollar left over boxes times crackers per box is the answer we have been so eagerly seeking for one share of berkshire a you will get nearly million crackers to be exact will weigh ounces or pounds which is over tons of crackers not to mention the weight of the waxed paper liner and the box that box is inches tall by inches wide by inches deep which means it occupies cubic inches of volume which trust me on this means that such boxes will occupy cubic feet or do not trust me on this if you come up with an answer that is different by even a single digit anywhere please do leave a comment if we assume a typical room whose floor to ceiling height is inches we can fit exactly of these boxes laid flat in a tower because inches divided by inches equals that tower will occupy times or cubic inches of volume which is cubic feet where the sixes repeat forever so the next obvious question is what the other two dimensions of the room must be to hold all boxes well it is obvious to me the number of towers necessary to make up boxes is simply the latter divided by the former which is such towers the footprint of each tower being square inches inches times inches that number times such towers is square inches of floor space the square root of that number means if the room is square the walls will be just a touch over inches which with your permission i am cavalierly going to round to inches divided by inches per foot is feet which i am even more cavalierly going to round to feet to contain the number of boxes of kellogg is sunshine cheez it mozzarella cheese pack of by cheez its you can buy for one share of berkshire hathaway class a stock as of april which is boxes you will need a typical height room that is square feet in area coincidentally that is about the size of the two car garage we mentioned earlier so now you know if you have read this far you might be wondering about some of the conversion formulas i did not show so here is the complete set to convert square inches to square feet divide by raised to the power of convert square feet to square inches multiply by raised to the power of convert cubic inches to cubic feet divide by raised to the power of convert cubic feet to cubic inches multiply by raised to the power of you are wondering how i managed to derive decimal places in that calculation of the square root of i used a wonderfully useful program called wolfram in case you are further interested that particular answer is expressed by wolfram to many thousands of digits so are not you glad i did not show them all based on all the foregoing i award this product stars minus for calling it creamy which is i am pretty sure equal to
