our cat family chicken and liver proplan saga the indoor dudes versus the outside feralsyear one the kittens versus the catsi was blessed with two kittens at approximately the same time one was a failure to thrive kitty with a compromised immune system and the one was a hey let is go eat everything in the kitchen and see how big we can get kitten at the time i got them from foster care both wighed pounds the failure to thrive kitty was months old and the go get um kitty was months old currently and pounds respectively i purchased pro plan chicken and liver kitten food from amazon asap i felt it would meet the nutritional needs of both boys so both would have the optimum chance to grow and and become as strong as possible having just lost a few months prior my best boy ever to a long standing kidney problem i though it was very important that my new family members have the most nutritious and boy safe food possible best boy died at the early age of twelve after cavorting his way through many adventures which included being kidnapped by a jealous female but that is a different part of this saga and will be published under a different proplan review both of my new boys had been eating dry food in their foster homes both were born of feral mothers they too would have grown up wild had a human rescuer not stepped in to save them as i was now the proud mom of two boy children i felt my responsibility to them heavily indeed quite deeply both should and would have more water in their diets to prevent urinary tract problems so i sought amazon is best though a bit pricey to me since best boy did much of his own meal planning and preparation i was unaccustomed to providing three ounce tins for my family but as the name implies wet food has water so wet food it was most little kitties inhale wet food if they have been on that dry stuff for any lenghth of time but neither kitten would eat it it was a puzzling situation in fact i was quite provoked with the boys because they turned their tiny noses up at this offering it had indeed cost me dollars and time and effort i finally shrugged my saddened sholders and somewhat unwillingly fed this chicken and liver kitten food to the feral cats that live in the area my feral kitties love it my outdoor children who regularly appear are a beautiful female long haired marmalade tabby a scruffy yellow and white tom who seems to be the head honcho in the neighborhood a black and white tom who suffers the lordship of head honcho and a short haired orange and grey female tabby who seems to never becomes with kittens i call them ferals but really they know me and sleep in the back yard when it is warm and in provided boxes which include warm towels when it is cold but feral they are they allow no petting in fact will let no one near them they may look content and docile lounging in the green grass but try to be friendly and they run we are very discreet and safely distanced partners in this dance of friendship that we have establish i do not know the rules they teach me as we get better acquainted the ferals seem to have estabished their haunt based somewhat upon a willing group of people who feed them i think of that group as the sneaky neigborhood ladies kitty kat klub i am a charter member it consists of those soft hearted women and some men who sneak the left overs or a tin of food out to the ferals when there spouse is not looking you know the spouse generally would want to know what in the h are you doing encouraging those flea bitten strays to hang around just a lot of trouble do not you know so we leave food out on a non scheduled basis just some of this or that when we have extra their feeding stations are random varying from night to night those guys seem to have a scouting system set checking the route daily to see who has food out i sometimes see one or two of them wending their way from back porch to patio to see what is available i have known them to turn things down now and again of course some are hungrier than others i am the kitty cat lady who fed them a couple of cases of pro plan kitten food because my kittens would not touch it so why did i run on about those feral cats well my guys turned up their nose at the chicken and liver but the ferals scarfed it down mine would rather eat a cent can of any brand seafood feast than this so you are probably thinking so write about something relevant lady a feral cat would happily eat roadkill why are you comparing the eating habits of inside only kittens to feral cats to start with that is an apples to oranges situation and you are just wasting my time warbling on about your blessed feral cats and whether they will deign to eat pro plan or not well my outside ferals live by a riparian area my back fence abuts this area the government planners can tell a big difference in that boundary but the cat can have his hind paws on my fence as his front paws head to the riparian area as he jumps the few inches to land thereon his parents or grandparents were likely tame kitties who were pitched out to a good neighborhood when some of my neighbors began to suffer financial problems as the economy has gone south but my feral guys were raised as true hunters and because of their location they have immediate access to all the baby rabbits mice voles moles and lizards thay they care to eat my hunter kitty who passed a few months ago hence my new kittens used to bring me presents of said items all the time there is just no shortage of available food proplan and leftovers are usually dessert it has been about a year since i had a really hungry kitty show up the long haired marmalade female came a few times and was ravenous but that was because she had just delivered a litter of kittens i have a very stable group o guys and to me their opinion counts nobody will eat clams cooked liver raw liver lamb or canned crab they do like campbell is chicken noodle soup so at my house we have who chow down on this and who do not the indoor dudes do not like it the outdoor dudes do like it update in december feline family composition has changed only one male previously mentioned indoor kitten remains his name is trinity now yr and did not like this pro plan food still does not care for it the other male kitten i had turned out to be severly immunosuppresed requiring more expensive trips to the vet than i could manage he found a permanent home with one of the vet is techs and is still with her til this day i see photos of this little black and white when we go to the a two and a half year old female who did not grow up on pro plan but will happily steal it from the new kittens she is a ticked tabby called kitten black majic aged mo loves kitten brown stripes mercy age mo loves feral kitty head honcho from above who is yellow and white very creativly named yellow and white kitty age unknown has been a neighborhood cat for approximately years i had him trapped neutered and returned about years ago he arrives for his daily meal at about p m he likes this food just fine he likes some others a bit better but certainly shows no disdain for it so his vote is a positive one other feral kitties the other ferals have moved on at this time dec i have only the one noted above as far as i know nothing bad happened to the other guys they just found other digs the last two kittens i got majic and mercy love this pro plan gabriella likes it just fine too when i have a lazy day i feed this kitten food to the adult tabby because the cans are right there and easy to grab she gives it a snif or two and then eats heartily any leftovers go to yellow and white kitty occasionally i run out of his friskies and he gets this instead eats it right down he prefers the days that i get lazy and give him a tin of human tuna albacore packed in water that i have found on sale somewhere but as a day in and day out dish he eats it fine since he is not a kitten it does not grace his dish often so two or so years after writing my first review on this product i find that is or so of the cats i feed like this just fine the kittens will continue to get it for about more months then i will switch the whole family of kitty kritters to the adult variety of chicken with liver i do not want anyone to be undernourished but feeding time can be bedlam and seeing that only the kittens receive this food is just not feasible but while the little ones do still need extra nourishment i will see that they get it butttttt do not want the adults to be over fed and become ungaily in size indoor dudes three like one does not outdoor dudes one likesso the number of stars stays the same stars four of my children recommend it i think if you give them this early on before they have a chance to be finicky your children will like it gabriella majic mercy and yellow kitty say buy on and a merry christmas and happy new years to you christmas
