i have been feeding blue buffalo foods to my golden retriever who is almost years old since i brought him home as a week old puppy as a veterinary technician i am aware of many common health problems in the breed allergies being one of them knowing that corn and other fillers can be the cause of allergies i wanted a food that only used the best ingredients i looked into many different brands that were reported to use quality ingredients blue buffalo it turned out was the only such brand that was readily available in my area the breeder had been feeding eukanuba puppy food so i started bruce on a mixture of the eukanuba puppy and the blue buffalo puppy he would actually pick out the eukanuba and only eat the b b kibbles one of my coworkers reports that her dachshund puppy did the same when she switched him to b b so i ultimately gave up on trying to mix the foods and just fed straight b b he would sometimes pick out those lifesource bits and leave them scattered all over the floor but is now a voracious eater and is not picky at all as he is now an adult i have been feeding him a variety of the b b flavors i started him with the b b large breed formula then switched to the fish and sweet potato then the lamb and so on i am hoping that by rotating the formulas i will be able to prevent or at least cut down on any food allergies and provide him with a healthy variety of nutrients since he quickly scarfs down any food i put down for him i can not see that he has any preference to flavor he loves them all i can report that to date bruce has been an extremely healthy dog his coat is thick and shiny his eyes are clear and he is a very solid lbs everyone that sees him oohs and aahs over how handsome he is i know a lot of that is genetics but i am sure blue buffalo had a little something to do with it as well
