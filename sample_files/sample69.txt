christ yahushua hamashiach is coming back do not leave this world without him gift of godwith all the bad going on in the world god wants us to tell everyone about his good news it is so fascinating always watching everything unfold just like the bible predicts i am often sent emails saying to forward it to everyone on my list if i am not ashamed of yahweh god and his messiah yahushua hamashiach jesus christ i do not forward those emails cuz i do not trust them i am not computer literate either so i am sending this to everyone on my list along with everyone else as god does command us no matter what the consequence to us to share his good news with every one of his messiah providing us with the only good way out of this world yep just like it says it is going to happen in the holy bible no matter which version is chosen to be believed or not believed it is gonna get beyond tragically ugly here if we think that there is been bad stuff already happening we ai not seen nothin yet pretty much if i remember correctly but it is in the bible god unleashes plagues the likes of which the world has never seen nor will see again remember sodom and gomorrah noah is ark and the great flood etc etc god abhors sin of which we are all guilty no matter how big or how small even the little white lie sin is sin to god and the penalty for sin is eternal death and separation from god the bible also tells of the mark of the beast that the coming world leader the anti christ will force everyone to take either on their right hand or forehead if you do not take the mark you will die the thing about that is that we are all going to die if you take the mark though you will be damned eternally to hell and without god the good news is that god loves us so much that he provided a way for us to be with him eternally in heaven instead of eternally dead in our sins for those who choose to believe repent turn back to god receive and follow his command not request to accept his only holy blood covering for our sins yahushua ha mashiach jesus the christ we will be allowed to join him in the new heaven and new earth that god says he will replace after all that is destroyed during this tribulation period of utter horrible death and destruction whether we believe in god or not heaven and hell or not we all believe that we are all going to die just like we all believe that we need air to breath even if we can not see the air along with if we jump off a tall building we will fall cuz of gravity which we also can not see etc etc the question is will we die only once with and for god if we repented received and followed the sin covering that god provided for us through the perfect shed blood sacrifice of his messiah yahushua who beat death and hell when he rose again and thus through his shed blood covering our sins we will be able to enter into heaven with god forever is our choice instead to reject god is messiah and take the easy way out while we still have to live in this world along with accepting the mark of the beast from the antichrist that is coming or already here that will lead this war against israel god says that we cannot serve two masters that we have to choose to live and die once for him or live and die forever without him it is just sad that people would rather have the temporary comfort leading to the eternal torment of satan than the temporary trouble leading to the eternal freedom and blessings of god god is word whether we choose to believe is real like him or not and which has been proven true and continues to do so i believe is as true as it was yesterday is today and will be forever just like him with his swift terrible justice and his immeasurable love for us all because he provided our eticket to heaven the sacrificed and risen yahushua the messiah will you die with god or without him will you die for him or against him will you accept the bail yahushua hamashiach that he paid on your behalf to get out of satan is hell so that you can enter into his heaven my prayer is that all will ask jesus christ yeshua or yahushua the messiah into their heart and follow him so that all may know god is plan for our eternal salvation rescue from our sins and eternal separation from god in hell through his perfect sinless sacrificial substitute for our sins yahushua and know his boundless unconditional love light ultimate peace power strength comfort mercy grace beauty healing hope joy and blessings for you are so very precious in his sight it is god is way that he says in his holy word is only through his holy son yahushua or the highway straight to hell may god have mercy on us all on our way to finding or rejecting and then serving him jesus is my hope in life and my life in death please take very good care shalom and may you find healing and eternal life in the holy name of jesus christ yahushua loves you
