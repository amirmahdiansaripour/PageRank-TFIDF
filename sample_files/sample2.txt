this is a nice idea but you can only fit half a sweet potato in it at a time you should instead buy yourself an immersion blender which is super easy to clean and useful for other things too steaming your food in a regular pot with a steamer basket is much faster and easier and you do not need to be plugged in to do it the babycook is so cute and the idea is so nice i just had to buy it i have some issues with the design as well as the function the lid is awkward to close a little lip on the lid has to slide into a little crevice on the body before you can use it very annoying to use and you cannot get the thing off when you are done unless you use two hands the food chopping function only happens when you have the switch turned so its never hands free except when you are steaming which takes longer than steaming on my gas stove the cord is also too short which is never good in the kitchen i did a test last night half of the sweet potato in the babycook and half on the stove chopped stove won it was done first but wait the babycook will puree too right so that was handy but in order to puree a potato you need additional water and that means a two handed removal of the lid and then the same thing to get it back on again if there are chunks its off again with the lid very annoying you can not fit much in the babycook to puree even after taking out the steaming basket you are still limited to one half of a sweet potato so i had to puree in batches an immersion blender is nice because you can move it around to get all the chunks you can tilt the container etc i got this as a gift i asked for it actually but now i would love to return it save your money and invest in an immersion blender for when you are making larger batches and a hand held food mill that does not need to be plugged in when baby eats what the family is eating but in a softer form definitely not recommended.
