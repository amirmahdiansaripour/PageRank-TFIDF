i consider quinoa to be one of the most versatile and valuable foods available on the planet a food which meets my standards for luxury gourmet in flavor and culinary versatility in addition to being baseline healthy with full spectrum nourishment if i had to be limited to only items or food groups in addition to water of course to eat or drink those would be quinoa coffee dairy products and a variety of greens spices nuts yeah okay dairy products and greens spices nuts may be considered more than items but for me they are two categories i am not a vegetarian because i love meat chicken and fish but if i am working with limitations i am making do with the most basic of basics while still having enough food items to concoct satisfying flavor yeah yeah and nutrition too though according to my beliefs nutrition dims and deteriorates unless it is in the living presence of yummy quinoa i believe would take care of all or at least many basic nutritional needs the way i simplify my use and preparation of quinoa is to think of it either as rice or oatmeal and then to gourmet it accordingly as rice i add savory herbs like parsley basil marjoram garlic onions etc actually most types of herb concoctions or side foods which could be blended with pasta would also work with quinoa think of what lidia is italian table does with noodle heaven then substitute quinoa for pasta i like pasta too of course as oatmeal i add sweet or rich ingredients like fruit including raisin and date types brown sugar molasses maple cream that type of thing as far as cooking instructions to me they are basically the same as rice add water or liquid in a to ratio cups liquid water broth vegetable or fruit juices to cup quinoa note that some brands vary this ratio slightly check their instructions on the product package instructions are given on the bag for boiling the water then adding the quinoa covering the pot and simmering for minutes i have also successfully prepared quinoa in the microwave you can heat the water to boil in a bowl use a large one with lots of room above the grain and water to avoid the mess of boiling over then add quinoa cover and cook depending on power levels and volume of food a microwave sometimes cooks times faster than outside the waves cooking as an example of time variance with larger amounts of food potato cooks on average in minutes potatoes require double that or minutes for a single serving cooked quickly in the microwave i might use cup quinoa with cup liquid i have simplified the process for myself by placing those single serving amounts quinoa and water in a bowl in the microwave and cooking it on high maybe minutes till the liquid bubbles then i cover the bowl with a plate lid zap it for another minute or half then let it steep in the microwave without opening it for another few minutes since microwave ovens and tastes for texture differ you will have to experiment with your own microwave processes to get results which work for you or just use the sauce pan method described on the bag in the microwave quinoa seems to cook easier than rice but i also cook rice in the microwave in a similar method i do not use minute rice since my microwave method works easily and fairly quickly and if i cook it in a serving bowl with a plate lid i can just place it on the table for family style digging in i love the nutty barley flavor of quinoa thankfully so does my husband recently health best quinoa alter eco fair trade arrowhead mills berry farm eden now foods and angelina is have been added to my list of purveyors of quinoa in the past i have purchased quinoa from bob is red mill and white mountain farms in colorado in the san juan mountain area have always been satisfied with those sellers when if the products are available on amazon having used many different now foods products i am also very confident in ordering their quinoa as well the reviews on quinoa red were helpful in addition to the most common golden grain i have only seen black quinoa which is also appealing and is reportedly the oldest variety well actually all the reviews i have read on quinoa have offered something of value to the info i have already gathered though i would happily purchase any of the available quinoa offerings on amazon currently i am favoring health best quinoa and alter eco fair trade for my personal use the extra details of info on the alter eco fair trade buying pages were appreciated and health best has an economical packaging proportioning to pricing i feel that these two purveyors provide a grain close enough to what the original seeds were intended to be i usually look at the proportion of water to cup quinoa called for in the purveyor is recipe i look for the recipe to call for cups water to cup quinoa any different proportion in my opinion means something may have been altered with the grain or packaging i also prefer to rinse the quinoa myself but at times bob is red mill is pre rinsed option is a blessing i used to sell quinoa in my city chef kitchen store which is no longer open i spend all my time writing now with a little cooking on the side quinoa has an interesting history including the development of a saponin coating on the grain the genetics in the quinoa seeds after eons and ages of growing had developed the saponin coating as a very effective protection against insects and burrowing varmints like worms or parasites knowing what saponin is and does i began a habit of saving some of the water used to rinse quinoa for watering my plants or pouring on the ground where i might want to discourage insects once the saponin is removed i am not sure how long the naked grains will be able to protect themselves again parasitic invasions certainly quinoa being a very strong wise old grain with high integrity for many reasons would be able to do so longer than other similar eon is younger food offerings i am not concerned about this and will usually order either pre washed grain or saponin coated whichever is readily available quinoa grows only above a foot elevation and requires a certain growing climate which can be found only in certain areas of the world some parts of the rocky mountains are one of those areas not tested until fairly recently in terms of the eons and ages associated with this ancient grain from the incas interesting stories about quinoa is long history are bountiful but i will not get into those a large assortment of books and pamphlets are available to read on it and of course many are offered here on amazon i remain ever thankful for magical foods which are both gourmet and healthy in quality especially in our era of being told by some authorities that we need to remove the life magic wholeness and flavor out of most everything for the sake of health here is an interesting question to ponder why and how for a while eons did we lose quinoa seeds which had lived and evolved long enough to develop saponin why and how did we find them again for an easy exotic recipe using quinoa see my review of
