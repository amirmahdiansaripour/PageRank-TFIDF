my reason for ordering the was not just to feed it to my baby since we make a great deal of our own baby food breast milk and homecooked and blended vegetables supplemented with heathy proteins and fats very low on the added sweeteners which includes fruit juices i ordered it to try out the packaging and a competing brand of organic baby food side by side and also to see if this was something someone i know with swallowing issues could tolerate with ease and enjoy so that said unto the main review let me first tell you that if you are willing to pay a little more to make sure your baby is not exposed to the bpa that lines the tops of most baby food jars or give them added starches salts this is a very good product and one that is labeled accurately by weight that in and of itself is hard to find these days the puree consists of organic pears organic broccoli organic spinach ascorbic acid organic lemon juice the last ingredients are likely there not just for flavor but to help retard the growth of any bacteria since this product has no other preservatives its shelf life is about months since mine were dated as sell by july baby organic does not disguise the fact that their is is a fresh product needing to be consumed quickely and i like that as far as a fruit serving goes and this is a fruit the vegetable in the product is not enough by weight to add much beyond some good extra vitamins iron the suggested serving size is the package but most people will find an older baby will be able to or will want to eat the entire thing so it is more like calories instead of the suggested in way way that is good news however since that means the product gives your child of the needed proten for the rda hopefully the rest is coming from breast milk or an approriate formula of the rda for vitamin a of the rda for vitamin c no calicium to speak of even though spinach is supposed to be a good source tells ya something and of of the rda for iron the biggest concern i have with this product is the packaging since that big plastic cap looks like a toy and if your child is clever enough to get it off the pouch once emptied you know it is going stright into their mouth where it woull be chewed upon and possible choked upon until they solve this issue by coming up with a better re sealable nozzle please immediately lock away all the caps up high and afr away from kids if you plan to recyle them the cap alone is why i took of star it seems they could have found a better system for resealing than this attractive hazard there are zipper openings on similar pouches with re sealable sticker strips that fold down over a ziplok type closure which could easily prevent a spill and provide for a second serving the choking hazard of that hiuge green button seal is my biggest concern now as for who liked it well everyone babies of the age mentioned had a blast eating the pear sauce since that is what it is really not noticing anything they should not like because when we served it i made sure to ask fellow moms not make faces and to just say yummy pears spinach with a smile preschoolers who tried it liked it and for the older kids we snuck it into home made yogurt with no other sweetener other than tiny bit of agave syrup drizzle on top for them to stir in along with chopped chunked pears nobody complained at all not even the parents eating the yogurt until after i told them what it was then they all claimed they could taste the greens straight away yeah right not now if you eat the product plain i admit the first bite has a bright bloom of broccoli or spinach flavor depending upon whom you ask but once you take a second spoonful you hardly notice at all i would eat this mixed into my yogurt for flavoring if only to induce my children to enjoy it even more the kids never noticed or cared it goes to show you how much we pass down our own food prejudices to our kids if we wrinkle our nose at something so likely will they better to just let them try it in a neutral atmosphere this leads me to my other reason for wanting to try this i have an older relative who has had throat cancer after several surgeries can now only eat pureed items or those horrid sugary liquid nutritional drinks i was hoping to try this out on my relative and see if she would enjoy this as a nice change of pace and she did however she can only manage about of the pouch per sitting which is a recommended serving there is really not enough vegetable matter in here to make this a decent regular option over say juiced kale spinach and carrot mixed into homemde yogurt but i gave it the ole college try a neighbor who is elderly and insulin dependent took two packages to carry in her purse and told me they were terrific options for correcting too strong a dose of insulin or for preventing a blood sugar crash between meals given these positive experiences with older folks i think baby gourmet might wish to consider branching out and thinking about these specialty markets too diabetics and people with swallowing and or digestion issues need a good organic bpa free option just as much as babies do baby gourmet already has a winning formula and manufacturing set up perhpas they will consider this other merket i have written to them about it in hopes they will consider possible other applications for their good bpa free foods while i still am disappointed that there is no appreciable protien or calcium in a baby food advertising itself as a fruit greens mix i like the product well enough to want to try their other flavors and to continue buying this one as a good prepared baby food back up option for when i do not have the time to m ake my own baby food other than breast milk i am very appreciative of the fact that baby gourmet makes a tasty product even adults can enjoy and further that their label is accurate by weight as has been pointed out by fellow vine program member work of life happy baby organic baby food is not quite so honest about their content like vine member work to life i highly rcommend the following book to any of you who are striving to raise healthy children in a grocery store amnnd marketing world full of deceptive labels and advertising these are great books to give as shower gifts along with books on breastfeeding asuch as
