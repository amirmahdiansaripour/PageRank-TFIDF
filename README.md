# Implementation of Page Rank and TF-IDF Algorithms with Apache Spark

**Apache Spark** is a great tool for distributed programming which helps segment a task between different nodes (cores) and allows the cores do their sub-tasks in parallel. In this project, I used Apache Spark with Java to implement two algorithms: **PageRank** and **Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF)**.


1. PageRank:



2. Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF):
